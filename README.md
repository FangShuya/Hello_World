# Hello_World
Congratulation to my first day in github
Purpose:
  Try to record daily improvement to encounter a better self.

Confusion:
  I used to love programming, but I have been getting lost for a long time. I am not sure about whether I am ensuthastic about it anymore. So  I 'd like to have a try and hope that time will bring me the answer.
  Do what I love and love what I do. The young does not waste for youth.
